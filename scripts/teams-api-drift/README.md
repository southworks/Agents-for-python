# Teams API drift detection

This ports the deterministic and advisory pipelines from Agents-for-js
[PR #1229](https://github.com/microsoft/Agents-for-js/pull/1229) and
[PR #1230](https://github.com/microsoft/Agents-for-js/pull/1230). It compares public
`microsoft-teams-api` contracts with recorded usage in
`microsoft-agents-hosting-msteams`; it does not automatically change SDK code or
adopt upstream features.

## Run locally

Use **Python 3.12** for the historical baseline: `microsoft-teams-api==2.0.0`
requires Python 3.12 even though newer versions support 3.11. Both snapshots use
the same interpreter. `TEAMS_API_PYTHON` can specify a different interpreter for
the disposable extraction/test environments when needed.

```bash
python -m pip install -r scripts/teams-api-drift/requirements.txt
python scripts/teams-api-drift/teams-api-drift.py compare --from 2.0.0 --to 2.0.16 --output artifacts/teams-api-drift/example
python scripts/teams-api-drift/teams-api-drift.py detect --comparison artifacts/teams-api-drift/example/raw-api-diff.json --output artifacts/teams-api-drift/example --fail-on-drift
python scripts/teams-api-drift/teams-api-drift.py render --findings artifacts/teams-api-drift/example/findings.json --output artifacts/teams-api-drift/example
```

Omit `--to` to query the latest stable, non-yanked PyPI release. Omit `--from` to
use the version installed in the calling interpreter. Each comparison installs
exact upstream versions in separate temporary virtual environments, which are
removed after extraction. An unsupported interpreter or unresolved dependency
is a failed extraction, never evidence of an unchanged API.

For the complete deterministic pipeline (including wheel builds and candidate
contracts/runtime tests), use a **fresh output directory**:

```bash
python scripts/teams-api-drift/teams-api-drift.py analyze --from 2.0.0 --to 2.0.16 --output artifacts/teams-api-drift/full
python scripts/teams-api-drift/teams-api-drift.py policy --mode scheduled --output artifacts/teams-api-drift/full
```

`analyze` deliberately collects failures without immediately failing. Inspect
`run-state.json` and `test-summary.json`, or invoke `policy` to enforce the final
result. Scheduled policy also requires successful advisory steps when the API
changed; a local deterministic run alone does not satisfy that advisory gate.
Individual comparison/detection/report commands do not call Copilot or publish
anything. Run `teams-api-drift.py --help` to list subcommands and append
`--help` after a subcommand for its options.

## Evidence and classification

- `baseline-api.json` / `candidate-api.json`: normalized public exports, methods,
  constructors, types and Pydantic fields, plus interpreter/extractor versions
  and the complete resolved package inventory.
- `raw-api-diff.json` / `teams-api.diff`: structured changes with deterministic
  `TSAPI-*` IDs and a readable diff excluding extraction metadata.
- `findings.json`: direct usage, affected source files, exposure, capability,
  evidence and classification for each upstream change.
- `test-summary.json`, stage logs and `deterministic-report.md`: actual build and
  candidate verification outcomes. Incomplete analysis is explicitly identified.
- `agent-context.json`, `agent-report.md`, `agent-report-validation.json`: bounded
  input, advisory output and mechanical validation results when AI runs.

Consumed removals and incompatible public contracts block adoption. Internal
contract changes require adaptation. Additive capabilities and uncertain changes
are for review; unrelated changes need no action. `--fail-on-drift` returns 1 for
blocking/required findings **after** writing the findings artifact. API extraction
does not compare method bodies: runtime checks cover selected behavioral contracts.

The classifier and context command accept `--public-api-report` using the source
port's schema (`package`, `status`, `publicSymbolChanges`, `upstreamTypeLeaks`).
Producing that separate extension public API baseline is outside this pipeline.

## Maintain the usage map

Update the checked-in `teams-api-usage-manifest.json` when adding an upstream
import, reading/writing a model field, constructing a client/model or changing
public exposure. Use fully qualified **import paths**, package-relative files,
snake_case field names and nested paths such as `settings.selected_channel.id`.
Record construction/validation explicitly so new required fields are detected.
The coverage check rejects missing direct imports and paths outside the source
tree. This is a curated usage map, not automatic whole-program data-flow analysis.

The adjacent `config/teams-capabilities.yaml` maps upstream module areas to
feature owners and adoption policies. It supports strict compatibility,
review-new-members and advisory-only policies. It does not authorize adoption.

## Workflows

PRs to `main` or `release/*` run tooling checks when its files change, and run
dependency analysis only when the Teams requirement in `setup.py` changes.
Manual PR-workflow dispatch takes explicit `from` and `to` versions. The weekly
workflow runs Monday at 08:00 UTC and compares the declared inclusive minimum
(currently 2.0.0) to the latest stable release, including future major versions.
The baseline advances only when maintainers raise that minimum.

Candidate verification installs locally built wheels plus the exact selected
Teams version. Candidates outside the supported range are tested in isolation
without changing SDK metadata; the report identifies the range exception.
The candidate's transitive dependencies, including `microsoft-teams-common`, are
recorded. Common's entire API is not compared; ClientOptions is covered by tests.

Trusted runs need `contents: read`, `copilot-requests: write`, and the applicable
`pull-requests: write` or `issues: write` permission. The repository/organization
must allow GitHub Copilot CLI requests using the workflow token. Copilot receives
only deterministic artifacts and relevant redacted source slices, capped at
12,000 characters per file, and is denied tools. Its report never authorizes
implementation. AI failures fail trusted runs where AI is required. Fork PRs
retain deterministic checks and artifacts without AI/publication requirements.

GitHub documents the token permission in
[Using Copilot CLI in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli-in-actions).
Actionlint 1.7.12 does not yet recognize `copilot-requests`; when validating these
workflows with that release, ignore only `unknown permission scope "copilot-requests"`.
Keep all other permission and workflow checks enabled.

Artifacts are uploaded for 21 days before publication and the final policy gate.
Trusted PRs upsert one marker-based summary comment. Changed scheduled comparisons
upsert one open advisory issue only after report validation. An unchanged comparison
does not automatically close an existing issue. No separate implementation issues
are created. Tokens are not included in artifacts.

## Validate changes

```bash
python -m pytest tests/teams_api_drift -o asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope=function
python -m mypy --config-file scripts/teams-api-drift/mypy.ini tests/teams_api_drift/contracts.py
python -m pytest tests/hosting_msteams -o asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope=function
python -m black --check scripts/teams-api-drift tests/teams_api_drift tests/hosting_msteams/test_api_boundaries.py
```

Static contracts and Teams tests require the local activity, hosting-core,
authentication-msal and hosting-msteams packages plus the candidate installed.
Offline tests mock GitHub publication and registry metadata. They never create
live comments or issues. On Windows, use a short environment path or extended
paths if the Graph dependency exceeds the system path-length limit.
